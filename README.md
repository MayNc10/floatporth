A softfloat library for Porth
This collection of files adds support for 32-bit IEEE-754 floating point numbers. Currently it supports conversions to and from integers, basic arithmatic, comparisons, raising to integer powers, and the sine() function.
It is planned to be IEEE-754 compliant, but is not currently.
